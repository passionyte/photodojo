            Photo Dojo JS is a fighting game based on the Nintendo DSiWare title "Photo Dojo" relased by Nintendo in 2009. <br>
            You can create your own fighter and background from images and sounds you provide! <br>
            It is simple to control your fighter! You can punch, jump, kick and shoot fireballs! <br>
            Outside of cool custom fighters and backgrounds, there is a Survival and a Versus mode. <br>
            In Survival, you fight hoards of your fighters and win once you defeat 100 of them! See how far you can get! <br>
            In Versus, you may fight a friend in two player multiplayer. Which one of you will come out on top?
